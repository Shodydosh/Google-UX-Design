# Google-UX-Design
User experience (UX) designers focus on the interaction that users have with products, like websites, apps, and physical objects. They make those everyday interactions useful, enjoyable, and accessible.

## Accessibility considerations for color
- Use icons in designs.
- Use patterns and texture to create contrast.
- Avoid color combinations that could be hard to distinguish.

## Low contrast sensitivity

## Iconography in UX design
- Make icons universal. Consider whether an icon is culturally or geographically specific before adding it to your designs. Will the icon make sense to a global audience, or only for users in the region where you live? Where will the users of the product you're designing be located? Your goal should be to include icons that everyone recognizes and understands, regardless of their background. For example, most users are familiar with the idea that the house icon means "home" which can help everyone navigate your app. 
- Consider including a text label. Usually, text labels are included in small font directly below an icon. Including a text label ensures that users who use a screen reader or a new adopter of technology are able to identify the icon. In addition, a text label can clearly describe (in one word!) what the icon means, like writing the label "Search" under a magnifying glass icon.
- Keep branding clear. Everything, including your icons, should reflect the imagery you’ve created for your brand. That means that everything across your app needs to have the same color scheme, the same font, and and the same style. For example, check out the [icon set](https://fonts.google.com/icons) for the Material Design website, and you’ll notice that the color and design flow well between each icon set, and none of the icons look out of place.
